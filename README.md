# WIXIE

a project for 2 digit nixie watch.
single button operation etc.
synchronised via RTC.
wireless charging.

//No alarms yet! (maybe in the future)
EDIT: ok, i thought about it and i think i implemented it somewhat okay.

possibly will be developing the PCB in the near future.

currently moved to a backburner, as it tested ok, but the driver chip for the nixies is KO.

if anyone is curious, ill upload the supposed k133ID1 delidded picture. by my assumption, its mighty suss.
  -of outer 16 pins, internally bonded only 14.
  -outer VCC pin isn't connected to anything, not even the base platform for the substrate (not even bonded directly to the platform, only glued).
  -lacking amount of output buffer transistors, i count only 7.
well, what could i expect from russians, huh (an attemted joke) :)

STILL DISLIKE LIBRARIES;
